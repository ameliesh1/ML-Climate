Four Week Plan to Predict Flooding in Different Boroughs in NYC and the Potential Impact on its Residents

**Week 1- Data Gathering**
1. Collect spatial data
2. Collect temporal data
3. Clean Data-the different datasets will have different formats, missing values, and coordinate systems so it needs to be so that everything is cohesive
      a. Standardize Coordinates so everything is based on the same system
      b. Create composite risk indices so that social factors have measurable risk scores (weights)
      c. Incorporate climate change projections over the years into risk models

**Week 2**
1. Begin building machine model using CNNs to process spatial data to detect patterns
      a. Split dataset into Train/Testing (80 percent or 20 percent)
      b. Aim to be able to show SHAP values, feature importance, and partial dependence plots
2. Start to interpret models

**Week 3**
1. Finish building CNN model
2. Cost-benefit analysis of potential interventions
3. Figure out potential improvements/solutions (by metric)

**Week 4**
1. Clean up any code that needs it
2. Write academic paper
      a.Abstract, introduction, data, methods, results, discussion, conclusion/recommendations
3. Have presentation ready
