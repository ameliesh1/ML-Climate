Current Dataset: https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-flood-data

Timeline: 

Week 1: Finalizing datasets, determining which datasets to focus on for the remainder of the project and establishing backup datasets. Finding a dataset that includes images to include a computer vision aspect of the project.

Week 2: Filtering through datasets we will be using, preparing data for usage in machine learning.

Week 3: Set up machine learning to make predictions on flooding based on data.

Week 4: Determine how unpredictable flooding is in the present compared to the past.

Weeks 5/6: Finalize results and write paper.
