Predicting Floods and Climate Risks for NYC Neighborhoods

In this paper, we will discuss the likelihood of flooding in different neighborhoods across the boroughs in New York City. Over time, factors such as deteriorating street conditions, increase in extreme weather events, and rising sea levels. In order to predict this, we constructed a machine learning model that utilizes convolutional neural networks to
