Predicting Floods and Climate Risks for NYC Neighborhoods

In this paper, we will discuss the likelihood of flooding in different neighborhoods across the boroughs in New York City. Over time, factors such as deteriorating street conditions, increase in extreme weather events, and rising sea levels have resulted in increased flooding in different areas of NYC. In order to predict how these factors impact certain neighborhoods, we constructed a machine learning model that utilizes convolutional neural networks to estimate the most flood prone areas in the city. We aim to accomplish this goal using flood datasets related to rainfall, infrastructure, and other hazards. Ultimately, the goal is to use the predictions drawn from our model in order to help mitigate the effects of the flooding, and come up with ideas for effective policy to improve these issues.
