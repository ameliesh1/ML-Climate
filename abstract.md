Classifying Wildfire Risk Zones

Through the decades, wildfires have become increasingly destructive due to climate change, with an average of 7 million acres burning a year, more than double since the 1990s. While geographic information system (GIS) based risk assessment methods exist, they face scalability limitations due to regional variability and tedious manual feature engineering requirements. As a result, we decided to focus our work on the open-source FireRisk dataset, which utilizes remote sensing, allowing the detection of an area’s physical characteristics from a distance. The dataset consists of 91,872 high-resolution NAIP aerial images labeled according to the Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) raster, which was crucial to developing an accurate deep learning framework for automated wildfire risk classification. We implement and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with spatial dropout and adaptive learning rates, comparing performance against both the original dataset benchmarks and reduced training sets to assess data efficiency. Our model achieves (FILL IN WHEN PROJECT COMPLETELY DONE)% accuracy in comparison to the established Masked Autoencoder benchmark of 65.29%, all while demonstrating significantly faster inference times than traditional GIS methods. By analyzing computational efficiency through CPU-GPU comparisons and energy consumption metrics, we provide actionable insights for deploying such models in resource-constrained wildfire management scenarios. Our work provides an optimized CNN architecture for fire risk classification and empirical validation of remote sensing’s potential to overcome GIS limitations in an attempt to support global wildfire prevention efforts. The results demonstrate how computer vision can be used to create early warning systems, with potential applications in risk mapping and preventive resource allocation.
